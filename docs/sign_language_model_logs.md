## best_something_something
### 
Many classes: 'yes', 'no', 'nothing', 'play', 'hey', 'record', 'feedback', 'save'
Performs pretty decently for the required job - however some things are triggered quite frequently. 05211204 solves this pretty well by adding the 'following' class.
## 05201104
###
Has classes 'play', 'hey', 'nothing', 'record', 'feedback', 'stop', performs decently.
It seems that the old one 'best_something_somethign' performed better even though it had mode classes
## 05211204
### 
This one has the new class: 'following' which is triggered when a fist is seeing being moved around
###
performs quite well other than play always being triggered after feedback gesture is made
## 05221133 
### 
Has the same classes as the prvious two.
### 
Stop is being triggered after 'record'
## 05221229

###
Everything performs great other than 'feedback' which is not always triggered.
## 05221319
