## Week 1
### Done this week
- Read and ran the ball tracker with pybullet arm simulation (video on [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QnhcysKL1fhK-SB1o6wS4MHmiphN7qrs/view?usp=sharing)
- Experimented with PyBullet (and QiBullet).

### Problems / confusions
- There is no high level motions implemented in QiBullet (i.e, walking, arm motions etc). Although not all hope is lost as some Webot motion hacks were found in an repository which could help writing this functionality for Qi/Py-bullet simulation. Or should I just deal with Naoqi only (this would then only be possible in the lab)?.
- Are arm movements just with inverse kinematics?
